Cardiac Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for building and training a machine learning model to predict cardiac disease. The project focuses on data exploration, preprocessing, and model development to achieve high accuracy in classification.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to develop an accurate predictive model for cardiac disease using a comprehensive dataset of health metrics. The notebook, cardiacml.ipynb, guides you through the entire machine learning pipeline:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the dataset's characteristics, distributions, and relationships.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.

Model Development: Training and evaluating various machine learning models, including a Random Forest Classifier.

Model Persistence: Saving the best-performing model for future use in a production environment (e.g., a web application).

ðŸ“Š Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing various health-related features to predict the presence of cardiac disease. The features likely include age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other relevant medical indicators. The dataset should be included in the repository or a link to it provided within the notebook.
